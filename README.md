# modular-embedded-stack

Credit card sized modular embedded stackable boards that was designed for fun for a microprocessor / microcontroller class. Base board is a microcontroller board that supports a 40-pin DIP PIC18F45K20 chip. Sensor board interfaces some basic sensors as well as some controllable lights to the microcontroller. Communication board will provide either bluetooth or some form of RF abilities to the stack.
