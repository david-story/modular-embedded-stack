# modular-embedded-stack

Credit card sized modular embedded stackable boards that was designed for fun for a microprocessor / 
microcontroller class. Base board is a microcontroller board that supports a thru-hole or smd PIC18F45K20 chip,
depending on which board you select. Daughter boards that are currently implemented have sensors and peripheals
that the user can interact with. 

The following is current included in the files:
- Board and schematic for thru-hole microcontroller
- Board and schematic for SMD microcontroller
- Board and schematic sensor daughter board

The following will be created in the future:
- Board and schematic for communication daughter board
- Other daughter boards and modules.
